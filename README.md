# django_user_manager

This project is a user profile management system built with Django and includes user authentication. 
It allows registered users to view a list of all profiles, with the ability to filter the results based on gender, hometown, and age range.
The system is built using Django's REST API filters and uses a Bootstrap template for the front-end, with JS for additional functionality. 
Users can also view the details of individual profiles, and there is a button to print the entire list.
